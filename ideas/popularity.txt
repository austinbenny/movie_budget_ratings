empirically determine pop of movie



- check that it works by seeing if how certain movies stack up against each other
    - something like minions cannot be more popular than endgame
        - maybe it can if you use age as a strata

- have to consider that you are living and analyzing things in a bubble
	- maybe endgame was only popular among your strata, not 0-14 yrs, or 40-60 yrs

- opening day box office might be good sign of pop, also budget since they can put more money into advertising
	- to be more exact, get data of opening box office by age range - dataset does not have, try boxofficemojo?


- use tmdb popularity feature and plot with budget and gross, try to add weights to the budget and gross to match up with tmdbs vs gross trendline
